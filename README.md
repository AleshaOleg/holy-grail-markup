## CSS-methodologies "101" examples: SMACSS, Atomic, BEM and so on.

### Helping you select an CSS methodologie
We wrote simple html page like "[Holy Grail Layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail_(web_design))"
in different CSS methodologies as an example of all popular css methodologies markup,
in order to help people compare, learn and start using them.

The same page, the same design implemented in using most of the popular CSS methodologies of today.

That's like an ~~"Hello world"~~ [TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc) for CSS.
