## CSS-methodologies "101" examples: SMACSS, Atomic, BEM and so on.

### Helping you select an CSS methodologie
We wrote simple html page like "[Holy Grail Layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail_(web_design))"
in different CSS methodologies as an example of all popular css methodologies markup,
in order to help people compare, learn and start using them.

The same page, the same design implemented in using most of the popular CSS methodologies of today.

That's like an ~~"Hello world"~~ [TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc) for CSS.

## How to use
Just download/clone repository and see examples of markup in each folder.
Keep in mind: `raw` is just example of default old ugly 2000-style css markup *without* any methodologie (just to compare),
but with trying to structuring code some way we did it before methodoligies coming.

[Demo](https://aleshaoleg.github.io/holy-grail-markup/raw) is here.

Specificity graphs for each implementetion, you can find by URL address, `https://aleshaoleg.github.io/holy-grail-markup/implementetion/specificity-graph`. For example, `raw` example here: http://aleshaoleg.me/holy-grail-markup/raw/specificity-graph.
